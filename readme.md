# Expensify

Unable to make up your mind on what to do next? This application is a bare bones React application that allows the user to add and delete items in a list. If the user is undecided what to do in the list, the button above the list will randomly select an item. You can visit the application [here](http://apps.indecision.caseycorder.com).
